// HOW PROMPT SYNC WORK

// The value assigned to the prompt variable is a function that allows you to get user input from the command line.

// Specifically, after this line:
// let prompt = require("prompt-sync")();

// require("prompt-sync") loads the prompt-sync module, which exports a function.
// The () immediately calls that function, returning another function that reads user input.
// So, prompt is now a function you can call like prompt("Enter something: ") to get input from the user as a string.

//  UNDEFINED + NUMBER  = NaN

// always be aware of the precidence of the statement in assignment
// process.stdout.write(reverse.join(",")); => alway excepts string
